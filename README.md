# Inception of Things

In this project, you'll be setting up several environments using different technologies, and learning how to use them effectively.

Before we get started, let me briefly introduce the technologies that we'll be using:

- **K3s**: a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for easy deployment on resource-constrained environments.
- **Vagrant**: a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments.
- **K3d**: a utility for creating and managing multi-node Kubernetes clusters using Docker.
- **Argo CD**: a continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that helps automate the deployment and management of applications in your environment.

Now that you have a basic understanding of the technologies we'll be using, let's dive into the project!

## Part 1: K3s and Vagrant

In this part of the project, you'll be setting up a K3s environment using Vagrant. By using Vagrant, you'll be able to create and manage a virtual Kubernetes environment with ease. You'll learn how to use Vagrant to spin up virtual machines and how to configure them to run K3s.

## Part 2: K3s and three simple applications

In this part, you'll be setting up three simple applications in your K3s environment. These applications will serve as test deployments to ensure that your environment is properly set up and functioning as expected. You'll learn how to deploy applications to a Kubernetes environment and how to monitor their status and health.

## Part 3: K3d and Argo CD

In the final part of the project, you'll set up K3d and Argo CD in your environment. K3d will allow you to create and manage multi-node Kubernetes clusters using Docker, while Argo CD will help automate the deployment and management of applications in your environment. You'll learn how to use these tools to set up
a scalable and efficient Kubernetes environment.

## Objectives

By completing this project, you'll have gained valuable experience in setting up and managing Kubernetes environments using a variety of tools and technologies. You'll be well-prepared to tackle real-world challenges in the field of containerization and orchestration.
